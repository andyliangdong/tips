# TipCalculator

This is a Tip Calculator application for iOS submitted as the [pre-assignment](https://gist.github.com/timothy1ee/7747214) requirement for CodePath.

Time spent: 10+ hours including watch video and resources

I have spent a lot of time on the setting page, but there are some bugs which will make the app quit.
I have no idea how to debug.

Completed:

* [2] Required: User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [5] Required: Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [] Optional: UI animations
* [] Optional: Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [] Optional: Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [] Optional: Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.
